# lua-resty-healthcheck

[![Build Status][badge-travis-image]][badge-travis-url]

A health check library for OpenResty.

## Synopsis

```nginx
http {
    lua_shared_dict test_shm 8m;
    lua_shared_dict my_worker_events 8m;
    init_worker_by_lua_block {

        local we = require "resty.worker.events"
        local ok, err = we.configure({
            shm = "my_worker_events",
            interval = 0.1
        })
        if not ok then
            ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to configure worker events: ", err)
            return
        end

        local healthcheck = require("resty.healthcheck")
        local checker = healthcheck.new({
            name = "testing",
            shm_name = "test_shm",
            checks = {
                active = {
                    type = "https",
                    http_path = "/status",
                    healthy  = {
                        interval = 2,
                        successes = 1,
                    },
                    unhealthy  = {
                        interval = 1,
                        http_failures = 2,
                    }
                },
            }
        })

        local ok, err = checker:add_target("127.0.0.1", 8080, "example.com", false)

        local handler = function(target, eventname, sourcename, pid)
            ngx.log(ngx.DEBUG,"Event from: ", sourcename)
            if eventname == checker.events.remove
                -- a target was removed
                ngx.log(ngx.DEBUG,"Target removed: ",
                    target.ip, ":", target.port, " ", target.hostname)
            elseif eventname == checker.events.healthy
                -- target changed state, or was added
                ngx.log(ngx.DEBUG,"Target switched to healthy: ",
                    target.ip, ":", target.port, " ", target.hostname)
            elseif eventname ==  checker.events.unhealthy
                -- target changed state, or was added
                ngx.log(ngx.DEBUG,"Target switched to unhealthy: ",
                    target.ip, ":", target.port, " ", target.hostname)
            else
                -- unknown event
            end
        end
    }
}
```

## Description

This library supports performing active and passive health checks on arbitrary hosts.

Control of the library happens via its programmatic API. Consumption of its events
happens via the [lua-resty-worker-events](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-worker-events) library.

Targets are added using `checker:add_target(host, port)`.
Changes in status ("healthy" or "unhealthy") are broadcasted via worker-events.

Active checks are executed in the background based on the specified timer intervals.

For passive health checks, the library receives explicit notifications via its
programmatic API using functions such as `checker:report_http_status(host, port, status)`.

See the [online LDoc documentation](http://kong.github.io/lua-resty-healthcheck)
for the complete API.

## History

Versioning is strictly based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

### 1.5.0 (09-Feb-2022)

* New option `checks.active.headers` supports one or more lists of values indexed by
  header name. [#87](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/87)
* Introduce dealyed_clear() function, used to remove addresses after a time interval.
  This function may be used when an address is being removed but may be added again
  before the interval expires, keeping its health status.
  [#88](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/88)

### 1.4.2 (29-Jun-2021)

* Fix: prevent new active checks being scheduled while a health check is running.
  [#72](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/72)
* Fix: remove event watcher when stopping an active health check.
  [#74](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/74); fixes Kong issue
  [#7406](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/7406)

### 1.4.1 (17-Feb-2021)

* Fix: make sure that a single worker will actively check hosts' statuses.
  [#67](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/67)

### 1.4.0 (07-Jan-2021)

* Use a single timer to actively health check targets. This reduces the number
  of timers used by health checkers, as they used to use two timers by each
  target. [#62](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/62)

### 1.3.0 (17-Jun-2020)

* Adds support to mTLS to active healthchecks. This feature  can be used adding
  the fields `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key`, with certificate and key respectively,
  when creating a new healthcheck object.
  [#41](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/41)

### 1.2.0 (13-Feb-2020)

 * Adds `set_all_target_statuses_for_hostname`, which sets the targets for
   all entries with a given hostname at once.

### 1.1.2 (19-Dec-2019)

 * Fix: when `ngx.sleep` API is not available (e.g. in the log phase) it is not
   possible to lock using lua-resty-lock and any function that needs exclusive
   access would fail. This fix adds a retry method that starts a new light
   thread, which has access to `ngx.sleep`, to lock the critical path.
   [#37](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/37);

### 1.1.1 (14-Nov-2019)

 * Fix: fail when it is not possible to get exclusive access to the list of
   targets. This fix prevents that workers get to an inconsistent state.
   [#34](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/34);

### 1.1.0 (30-Sep-2019)

 * Add support for setting the custom `Host` header to be used for active checks.
 * Fix: log error on SSL Handshake failure
   [#28](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/28);

### 1.0.0 (05-Jul-2019)

 * BREAKING: all API functions related to hosts require a `hostname` argument
   now. This way different hostnames listening on the same IP and ports
   combination do not have an effect on each other.
 * Fix: fix reporting active TCP probe successes
   [#20](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/20);
   fixes issue [#19](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/issues/19)

### 0.6.1 (04-Apr-2019)

 * Fix: set up event callback only after target list is loaded
   [#18](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck/pull/18);
   fixes Kong issue [#4453](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/4453)

### 0.6.0 (26-Sep-2018)

 * Introduce `checks.active.https_verify_certificate` field.
   It is `true` by default; setting it to `false` disables certificate
   verification in active healthchecks over HTTPS.

### 0.5.0 (25-Jul-2018)

 * Add support for `https` -- thanks @gaetanfl for the PR!
 * Introduce separate `checks.active.type` and `checks.passive.type` fields;
   the top-level `type` field is still supported as a fallback but is now
   deprecated.

### 0.4.2 (23-May-2018)

 * Fix `Host` header in active healthchecks

### 0.4.1 (21-May-2018)

 * Fix internal management of healthcheck counters

### 0.4.0 (20-Mar-2018)

 * Correct setting of defaults in `http_statuses`
 * Type and bounds checking to `checks` table

### 0.3.0 (18-Dec-2017)

 * Disable individual checks by setting their counters to 0

### 0.2.0 (30-Nov-2017)

 * Adds `set_target_status`

### 0.1.0 (27-Nov-2017) Initial release

 * Initial upload
